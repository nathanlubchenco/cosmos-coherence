> Spec: FaithBench Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Implement the FaithBench hallucination detection benchmark to evaluate LLM factual consistency across diverse knowledge domains. This feature will enable systematic evaluation of model reliability using FaithBench's comprehensive dataset and scoring methodology, providing crucial baseline metrics for the coherence-based analysis framework.

## User Stories

### Benchmark Researcher

As a benchmark researcher, I want to run FaithBench evaluations on different LLMs, so that I can compare hallucination rates across models and establish baseline metrics for coherence analysis.

The researcher loads the FaithBench dataset, configures target models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5), runs evaluations with customizable parameters (temperature, sample size), and receives comprehensive metrics including accuracy scores, hallucination rates by domain, and confidence distributions. Results are stored in standardized format for comparison with other benchmarks.

### ML Engineer

As an ML engineer, I want to integrate FaithBench into automated testing pipelines, so that I can monitor model performance degradation and hallucination trends over time.

The engineer configures FaithBench as part of the benchmark suite, sets up batch processing for large-scale evaluations, monitors progress through CLI or API, and exports results to tracking systems. The implementation supports parallel processing and checkpoint recovery for long-running evaluations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Dataset Loader** - Implement FaithBench dataset loading with support for all question categories and difficulty levels
2. **Evaluation Pipeline** - Create evaluation workflow with prompt generation, response collection, and hallucination detection logic
3. **Metrics Calculation** - Implement FaithBench-specific metrics including domain-wise accuracy and hallucination classification
4. **Result Storage** - Store evaluation results in standardized format compatible with experiment tracking system
5. **CLI Integration** - Add FaithBench commands to existing CLI for running evaluations and viewing results

## Out of Scope

- Custom FaithBench dataset modifications or extensions
- Real-time streaming evaluation (batch processing only)
- GUI interface for FaithBench configuration
- Model fine-tuning based on FaithBench results

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional FaithBench evaluations runnable via CLI with results matching reference implementation accuracy within 2%
2. Complete test coverage for dataset loading, evaluation pipeline, and metrics calculation
3. Integration with existing experiment tracking showing FaithBench results alongside other benchmarks
