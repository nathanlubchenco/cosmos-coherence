> Spec: Pydantic Configuration System
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Implement a type-safe, composable configuration system using Pydantic that manages all experiment parameters across benchmarks, models, and coherence strategies. This system will provide validation, inheritance, and environment variable support to ensure reproducible and flexible experimentation workflows.

## User Stories

### Configuration Management for Experiments

As a researcher, I want to define experiment configurations in YAML files with full type safety and validation, so that I can easily reproduce experiments and avoid runtime errors from misconfiguration.

The workflow involves creating a base configuration file that defines common parameters (API keys, output directories, logging levels), then extending it with specific configurations for each experiment run. The system should validate all parameters at startup, checking model-specific constraints like temperature ranges for reasoning models. When running experiments, I can override specific parameters via command-line arguments or environment variables without modifying the base configuration files.

### Grid Search Across Benchmark Combinations

As a researcher, I want to compose configurations for benchmark × model × strategy combinations, so that I can systematically explore the parameter space and compare results.

The system should allow me to define a grid of experiments by combining different benchmark configurations (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA) with various model settings (GPT-4, GPT-4o, o1-preview) and coherence strategies (baseline, k-response, Shogenji, Fitelson, Olsson). Each combination should inherit from base configurations while allowing specific overrides. The configuration system should generate all valid combinations and validate them against model-specific constraints.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pydantic Models** - Define comprehensive configuration schemas for experiments, benchmarks, models, and strategies
2. **YAML Parser** - Implement YAML loading with environment variable interpolation and file inclusion
3. **Configuration Inheritance** - Support base configurations with override mechanisms for experiments
4. **Model-Specific Validation** - Enforce constraints based on OpenAI model capabilities and requirements
5. **Configuration CLI** - Provide command-line interface for loading, validating, and overriding configurations

## Out of Scope

- Configuration migration between versions
- Web-based configuration editor
- Real-time configuration updates during execution
- Configuration storage in databases

## Expected Deliverable

1. Load and validate a YAML configuration file with nested structures for benchmark, model, and strategy settings
2. Override configuration values using environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY) and command-line arguments
3. Generate valid configuration combinations for grid search experiments with automatic constraint validation
