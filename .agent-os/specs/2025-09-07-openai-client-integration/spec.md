> Spec: OpenAI Client Integration with High-Throughput Capabilities
> Created: 2025-09-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a rate-limited OpenAI API wrapper with support for batch processing and concurrent connections to maximize throughput for benchmark evaluations. This client will enable efficient temperature-variant analysis across multiple benchmarks while managing API rate limits and costs effectively.

## User Stories

### Research Scientist Running Large-Scale Benchmarks

As a research scientist, I want to run thousands of benchmark queries through OpenAI models efficiently, so that I can complete hallucination detection experiments in reasonable timeframes without hitting rate limits.

The scientist loads a benchmark dataset (e.g., 1000 questions from TruthfulQA), configures temperature variations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0), and initiates the evaluation. The system automatically manages concurrent requests, handles rate limiting, and uses batch API when appropriate to maximize throughput. Progress is displayed in real-time, and partial results are saved periodically to prevent data loss.

### Developer Integrating New Benchmarks

As a developer, I want a simple, configurable API client that handles all OpenAI communication details, so that I can focus on implementing benchmark logic without worrying about rate limits or connection management.

The developer creates a new benchmark class, configures the OpenAI client through Pydantic models, and calls simple methods like `generate_response()` or `batch_generate()`. The client automatically handles retries, rate limiting, and optimal request batching based on the configured parameters.

### Cost-Conscious Researcher

As a researcher with limited budget, I want to use OpenAI's batch API for non-urgent evaluations to reduce costs, so that I can run more experiments within my budget constraints.

The researcher configures a benchmark run with `use_batch_api: true` and submits thousands of queries. The system automatically creates batch jobs, monitors their completion, and retrieves results when ready, achieving up to 50% cost savings on large evaluation runs.

## Spec Scope

1. **Rate-Limited Client** - Implement a client wrapper that respects OpenAI's rate limits with exponential backoff and retry logic
2. **Concurrent Request Management** - Support configurable concurrent connections to maximize throughput within rate limits
3. **Batch API Integration** - Implement support for OpenAI's batch API for cost-effective large-scale evaluations
4. **Progress Tracking** - Provide real-time progress updates and resumable evaluation capabilities
5. **Configuration Management** - Pydantic-based configuration for API keys, model parameters, and throughput settings

## Out of Scope

- Fine-tuning or model training capabilities
- Streaming response support (not needed for benchmark evaluations)
- Non-OpenAI LLM providers (separate future specs)
- Cost tracking and billing management beyond basic token counting
- Interactive chat or conversation management

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional OpenAI client that can process 1000+ benchmark queries efficiently using concurrent connections and/or batch API
2. Configuration system that allows easy adjustment of concurrency, rate limits, and batch vs. real-time processing
3. Integration with existing benchmark framework demonstrating at least 5x throughput improvement over sequential processing
