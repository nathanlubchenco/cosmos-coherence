# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a high-throughput OpenAI API client with rate limiting, concurrent connections, and batch API support to enable efficient benchmark evaluations at scale. The client will maximize throughput for temperature-variant hallucination detection experiments while managing costs through batch processing options, targeting at least 5x performance improvement over sequential processing.
