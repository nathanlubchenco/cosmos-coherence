# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-openai-client-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Client Architecture
- **Async-first design** using Python's asyncio for concurrent request handling
- **Connection pooling** with configurable pool size (default: 10 concurrent connections)
- **Request queue management** with priority support for time-sensitive evaluations
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Rate limit tracking** per model/endpoint with adaptive throttling

### Batch API Implementation
- **Batch job creation** for requests exceeding configurable threshold (default: 100 requests)
- **Job status monitoring** with periodic polling and webhook support
- **Result retrieval and parsing** with automatic retry for incomplete batches
- **Hybrid mode** supporting both real-time and batch processing in single evaluation run
- **Cost optimization logic** to automatically choose batch vs. real-time based on urgency

### Concurrency Management
- **Semaphore-based connection limiting** to respect OpenAI rate limits
- **Token bucket algorithm** for fine-grained rate limiting
- **Request batching** for efficient API utilization within rate limits
- **Adaptive concurrency** that adjusts based on observed rate limit headers
- **Circuit breaker pattern** to prevent cascade failures

### Configuration System
- **Pydantic models** for type-safe configuration:
  - `OpenAIConfig`: API keys, base URLs, timeout settings
  - `RateLimitConfig`: Requests per minute, tokens per minute, concurrent connections
  - `BatchConfig`: Batch size thresholds, polling intervals, cost preferences
  - `RetryConfig`: Max retries, backoff strategies, timeout policies
- **Environment variable support** with `.env` file integration
- **Per-model configuration** supporting different settings for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.

### Progress and State Management
- **Persistent state storage** using JSON/JSONL for resumable evaluations
- **Real-time progress tracking** with tqdm integration
- **Checkpoint system** saving partial results every N requests (configurable)
- **Graceful shutdown handling** to prevent data loss
- **Metrics collection** for throughput, latency, and error rates

### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive exception hierarchy** for different failure modes
- **Automatic retry classification** (retryable vs. non-retryable errors)
- **Detailed error logging** with request/response context
- **Fallback strategies** for degraded service scenarios
- **Cost tracking** to prevent budget overruns

### Integration Points
- **Abstract base client** that benchmark implementations can extend
- **Standardized response format** compatible with existing benchmark models
- **Temperature variation support** with automatic request multiplication
- **Token counting** using tiktoken for accurate usage tracking
- **Callback system** for custom logging and monitoring

## External Dependencies

- **openai** (>=1.0.0) - Official OpenAI Python client library
  - **Justification:** Required for API communication and batch job management
- **tiktoken** (>=0.5.0) - OpenAI's token counting library
  - **Justification:** Accurate token counting for rate limit management and cost estimation
- **aiohttp** (>=3.9.0) - Async HTTP client
  - **Justification:** High-performance concurrent HTTP requests with connection pooling
- **tenacity** (>=8.2.0) - Retry library with advanced strategies
  - **Justification:** Sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- **aiolimiter** (>=1.1.0) - Async rate limiter
  - **Justification:** Token bucket implementation for precise rate limiting

## Performance Targets

- **Throughput:** Minimum 5x improvement over sequential processing
- **Latency:** P95 request latency under 2 seconds for real-time mode
- **Reliability:** 99.9% success rate with automatic retries
- **Efficiency:** Less than 5% overhead from concurrency management
- **Scalability:** Support for 10,000+ requests per evaluation run
