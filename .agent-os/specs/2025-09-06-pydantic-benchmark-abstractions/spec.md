> Spec: Pydantic Benchmark Abstractions
> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Core Pydantic abstractions for type-safe benchmark data management supporting the complete workflow from dataset download to result consumption

## User Stories

### Researchers running benchmarks
- As a researcher, I want type-safe models for benchmark datasets so that I can confidently work with standardized data structures
- As a researcher, I want validation-enabled experiment tracking so that my benchmark runs are properly recorded with all required metadata
- As a researcher, I want serializable result structures so that I can persist and share my evaluation outcomes

### Developers extending the framework
- As a developer, I want well-defined Pydantic models for different benchmark types so that I can easily add support for new benchmarks
- As a developer, I want data transformation pipelines with type safety so that I can build reliable data processing workflows
- As a developer, I want consistent serialization/deserialization support so that data can be reliably stored and retrieved

### Analysts viewing results
- As an analyst, I want structured result data models so that I can programmatically analyze benchmark outcomes
- As an analyst, I want standardized experiment metadata so that I can compare results across different benchmark runs
- As an analyst, I want JSON/JSONL compatible data structures so that I can integrate with analysis tools and databases

## Spec Scope

- Dataset models for multiple benchmarks (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA, FEVER, HaluEval)
- Experiment tracking models
- Evaluation result structures
- Data transformation pipelines
- Serialization/deserialization support

## Out of Scope

- Configuration management (already exists)
- API endpoint implementations
- UI/visualization components
- Actual benchmark execution logic

## Expected Deliverable

Type-safe Pydantic models for benchmark datasets, validation-enabled experiment and result tracking, serializable data structures for JSON/JSONL persistence
