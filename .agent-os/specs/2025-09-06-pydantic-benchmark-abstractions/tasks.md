# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-pydantic-benchmark-abstractions/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Base Models and Core Abstractions âœ…

Create the foundational Pydantic models that will serve as the backbone for all benchmark data structures.

- [x] 1.1 Write comprehensive tests for base model structure and validation rules
- [x] 1.2 Implement BaseModel with common fields (id, timestamp, metadata)
- [x] 1.3 Create BenchmarkConfig model for benchmark parameters and settings
- [x] 1.4 Implement DataPoint base class with generic typing support
- [x] 1.5 Create ValidationMixin for common validation patterns
- [x] 1.6 Add serialization helpers and custom field types
- [x] 1.7 Implement model inheritance structure for extensibility
- [x] 1.8 Verify all base model tests pass with 100% coverage

### 2. Dataset-Specific Models

Implement specialized Pydantic models for each of the 5 hallucination detection benchmark datasets with their unique schemas and validation requirements.

2.1 Write test cases for all 5 benchmark dataset models and their specific validation rules
2.2 Implement FaithBench dataset model with factual consistency checking and evidence tracking
2.3 Create SimpleQA model with straightforward Q&A structure and grounding validation
2.4 Implement TruthfulQA model with truthfulness scoring and informativeness metrics
2.5 Create FEVER model with claim verification, evidence retrieval, and verdict classification
2.6 Implement HaluEval model with hallucination detection across different generation tasks
2.7 Add dataset-specific validators and custom field constraints
2.8 Verify all dataset model tests pass with proper schema validation

### 3. Experiment and Result Models

Build comprehensive tracking and evaluation structures for benchmark experiments and their results.

3.1 Write tests for experiment tracking, result aggregation, and metrics calculation
3.2 Implement Experiment model with configuration, metadata, and execution tracking
3.3 Create Result model with score tracking, timing, and error handling
3.4 Implement Metrics model with statistical calculations and benchmarking standards
3.5 Create ExperimentRun model for individual test executions and their outcomes
3.6 Add aggregation models for batch processing and summary statistics
3.7 Implement result comparison and diff tracking functionality
3.8 Verify all experiment and result tests pass with accurate metric calculations

### 4. Serialization and Validation

Implement robust JSON/JSONL support, custom validators, and data integrity checks across all models.

4.1 Write tests for JSON/JSONL serialization, deserialization, and validation edge cases
4.2 Implement custom JSON encoders/decoders for complex data types
4.3 Create JSONL streaming support for large dataset processing
4.4 Add comprehensive field validators with meaningful error messages
4.5 Implement data integrity checks and cross-field validation
4.6 Create schema versioning and migration support
4.7 Add performance optimizations for serialization of large datasets
4.8 Verify all serialization tests pass with proper error handling and performance benchmarks

### ~~5. API Integration Models~~ (Moved to Phase 3 of roadmap)

*Note: API integration models have been deferred to Phase 3 when we build the dashboard and API layer. Focus remains on core benchmark functionality first.*
