# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Repository Scaffolding
> Created: 2025-09-05

## Overview

Establish comprehensive repository scaffolding including .gitignore configuration, pre-commit hooks for code quality, and basic repository structure standards. This will ensure consistent code quality, prevent sensitive data exposure, and maintain a clean repository structure throughout development.

## User Stories

### Developer Repository Setup

As a developer, I want comprehensive repository scaffolding, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent accidental commits of sensitive or unnecessary files.

When setting up the development environment, developers need proper .gitignore rules to exclude build artifacts, cache files, environment files, and IDE-specific files. Pre-commit hooks should automatically run linting, formatting, and basic tests before allowing commits. This ensures all code meets quality standards before entering the repository.

### Team Collaboration Standards

As a team member, I want consistent pre-commit checks, so that all contributors follow the same code quality standards automatically.

Pre-commit hooks should validate Python code formatting (black), linting (ruff), type hints (mypy), and prevent commits of large files or files with merge conflicts. This creates a consistent development experience across all contributors.

## Spec Scope

1. **Comprehensive .gitignore** - Python-specific gitignore with coverage for common IDEs, OS files, and project artifacts
2. **Pre-commit hook configuration** - Setup pre-commit framework with Python linting, formatting, and validation hooks
3. **Development environment files** - Template .env.example file for required environment variables
4. **Editor configuration** - EditorConfig file for consistent coding standards across different editors
5. **Repository badges** - README badges for test status, code coverage, and Python version

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Advanced security scanning hooks
- Custom git hooks beyond pre-commit framework
- Documentation generation hooks

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working .gitignore that properly excludes all development artifacts and sensitive files
2. Pre-commit hooks that automatically run on git commit, validating code quality
3. Clear setup instructions in README for initializing development environment with pre-commit
