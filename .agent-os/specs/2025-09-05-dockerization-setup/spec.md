# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Dockerization Setup
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Containerize the Cosmos Coherence application to provide consistent development and deployment environments. This involves creating Docker configurations for the Python-based LLM hallucination detection framework, including its FastAPI backend and Dash frontend components. The containerization will enable easy portability across different environments and simplify the development setup process for new contributors.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to run the entire application stack with a single command so that I can quickly start development without complex setup
- I want consistent Python 3.11+ environment across all development machines so that "it works on my machine" issues are eliminated
- I want hot-reloading during development so that I can see changes immediately without rebuilding containers
- I want to easily switch between development and production configurations

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want standardized container images so that deployment is predictable across environments
- I want optimized production images so that resource usage is minimized
- I want clear separation between development and production builds so that security and performance are maintained

### As a New Contributor
- I want to get the application running locally with minimal setup so that I can start contributing quickly
- I want clear documentation on how to work with the containerized environment

## Spec Scope

- **Docker Configuration**: Create Dockerfile for the main application with multi-stage builds
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose setup with hot-reloading and development dependencies
- **Production Environment**: Optimized production Docker configuration
- **Poetry Integration**: Proper handling of Poetry dependency management within containers
- **Service Architecture**: Separate containers for FastAPI backend and Dash frontend if needed
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration management for different environments
- **Volume Mapping**: Proper handling of code, data, and cache directories
- **Networking**: Internal container networking configuration
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring setup

## Out of Scope

- **Kubernetes Configuration**: Orchestration beyond Docker Compose
- **Cloud Deployment**: Specific cloud provider deployment configurations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and deployment workflows (separate spec)
- **Database Containerization**: If external databases are used, their containerization
- **Monitoring/Logging**: Advanced observability setup (separate spec)
- **Security Hardening**: Advanced security configurations beyond basic practices

## Expected Deliverable

- **Working Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build supporting both development and production
- **Docker Compose Files**: Separate configurations for development and production environments
- **Environment Configuration**: Template files for environment variables
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for developers on how to use the Docker setup
- **Scripts**: Helper scripts for common Docker operations (build, run, clean)
- **Validation**: All services start successfully and communicate properly in containerized environment
