# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-dockerization-setup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Configuration Requirements

**Multi-stage Builds**
- Implement multi-stage Dockerfile with separate stages for dependencies, development, and production
- Use builder stage for Poetry dependency installation to minimize final image size
- Leverage Docker layer caching for faster rebuilds during development

**Base Images**
- Use official Python 3.11-slim as base image for optimal size/functionality balance
- Consider Alpine variants for production deployments if size is critical
- Pin specific image versions (e.g., python:3.11.7-slim) for reproducible builds

**Layer Optimization**
- Order Dockerfile instructions to maximize cache hits (dependencies before source code)
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files (tests, documentation, .git)
- Combine RUN commands where appropriate to reduce layer count
- Clean up package caches in same RUN command to minimize layer size

### Poetry Integration Within Docker

**Dependency Management**
- Install Poetry in builder stage using pip
- Copy pyproject.toml and poetry.lock before installing dependencies
- Use `poetry config virtualenvs.create false` to install directly to system Python
- Leverage `poetry install --no-dev` for production builds
- Use `poetry export` for requirements.txt generation if needed for optimization

**Build Process**
```dockerfile
# Install Poetry
RUN pip install poetry==1.6.1

# Configure Poetry
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false

# Install dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry install --no-dev --no-interaction --no-ansi
```

### Environment Variable Management

**Configuration Strategy**
- Use environment variables for all configurable parameters
- Provide sensible defaults in application code
- Use .env files for development with docker-compose
- Implement separate env configs for dev/staging/prod environments

**Required Environment Variables**
- `ENVIRONMENT`: dev/staging/production
- `DEBUG`: boolean flag for debug mode
- `LOG_LEVEL`: logging verbosity
- `DATABASE_URL`: if database is used
- `REDIS_URL`: if caching is implemented
- Application-specific configuration variables

**Security Considerations**
- Never include secrets in Dockerfile or images
- Use Docker secrets or external secret management for production
- Validate environment variables on application startup

### Volume Mounting for Development

**Development Volumes**
- Mount source code directory for hot reloading: `./:/app`
- Mount Poetry cache directory: `~/.cache/pypoetry:/root/.cache/pypoetry`
- Mount pip cache: `~/.cache/pip:/root/.cache/pip`
- Separate volumes for persistent data (databases, logs)

**Volume Configuration**
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./:/app:cached  # Source code with cached consistency
  - poetry-cache:/root/.cache/pypoetry
  - pip-cache:/root/.cache/pip
```

### Service Architecture

**FastAPI Service**
- Run FastAPI with uvicorn server
- Configure worker processes based on CPU cores
- Implement health check endpoints
- Use gunicorn for production deployments
- Expose on configurable port (default 8000)

**Dash Service**
- Separate container for Dash application if needed
- Configure for development vs production serving
- Implement proper asset serving strategy
- Consider reverse proxy for production

**Supporting Services**
- Redis container for caching/session storage if required
- Database container (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for development
- Nginx reverse proxy for production load balancing
- Monitoring containers (optional)

**Inter-service Communication**
- Use Docker networks for service isolation
- Implement service discovery via container names
- Configure proper port exposure and internal routing

### Development vs Production Configurations

**Development Configuration**
- Enable hot reloading and debug mode
- Mount source code volumes
- Use development database (SQLite or containerized)
- Enable verbose logging
- Expose additional debugging ports

**Production Configuration**
- Multi-worker deployment with gunicorn
- Optimized image with minimal dependencies
- External database connections
- Structured logging with proper levels
- Health checks and restart policies
- Resource limits and constraints

**Docker Compose Overrides**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - base configuration
# docker-compose.dev.yml - development overrides
# docker-compose.prod.yml - production overrides
```

### Performance Considerations

**Image Size Optimization**
- Use multi-stage builds to exclude build dependencies
- Implement proper .dockerignore patterns
- Clean up package caches and temporary files
- Consider distroless images for production

**Runtime Performance**
- Configure appropriate worker processes
- Set memory and CPU limits
- Implement connection pooling for databases
- Use caching strategies (Redis, in-memory)
- Optimize Python startup time

**Build Performance**
- Leverage Docker BuildKit for faster builds
- Implement build caching strategies
- Use registry cache for CI/CD pipelines
- Parallelize multi-stage builds where possible

### Security Best Practices for Containers

**Image Security**
- Scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy
- Use non-root user in containers
- Pin specific versions for reproducible builds
- Regularly update base images

**Runtime Security**
- Run containers with minimal privileges
- Use read-only filesystems where possible
- Implement proper network isolation
- Configure security contexts and capabilities

**Secrets Management**
- Never include secrets in images or environment variables
- Use Docker secrets or external secret management
- Implement proper secret rotation strategies
- Audit secret access and usage

**Network Security**
- Use custom Docker networks instead of default bridge
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use TLS for inter-service communication
- Configure appropriate port exposure

## Approach

**Implementation Strategy**
1. Create base Dockerfile with multi-stage build
2. Implement docker-compose setup for development
3. Configure environment variable management
4. Set up volume mounting for development workflow
5. Create production-optimized configuration
6. Implement security hardening measures
7. Add monitoring and health checks
8. Document deployment procedures

**Development Workflow**
- Use docker-compose for local development
- Implement hot reloading for faster iteration
- Provide easy setup commands for new developers
- Include debugging capabilities and tools

**Deployment Strategy**
- Container registry integration (Docker Hub, ECR, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- Rolling deployment strategy for production
- Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
