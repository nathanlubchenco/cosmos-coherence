> Spec: Benchmark Harness Framework

> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a robust benchmark execution framework that prioritizes exact reproduction of existing benchmark results to establish validated baselines, while extending capabilities for temperature-variant analysis and coherence-based evaluation. This framework must first prove it can faithfully reproduce published benchmark results (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA) before applying novel coherence measures, ensuring our research builds on a solid foundation of reproducible science.

## User Stories

### Benchmark Researcher Validating Reproducibility

As a benchmark researcher, I want to reproduce exact results from published hallucination benchmarks, so that I can validate our implementation and establish trusted baselines before introducing novel methods.

The researcher runs FaithBench, SimpleQA, or TruthfulQA with their original evaluation settings (temperature=0, deterministic sampling), comparing outputs against published accuracy scores and example responses. The system provides detailed comparison reports showing metric alignment, response consistency, and any deviations from expected results. Only after achieving reproduction within acceptable tolerance (±1% of published scores) does the researcher proceed to temperature-variant experiments.

### Research Scientist Running Experiments

As a research scientist, I want to run multiple hallucination benchmarks with varying temperature settings, so that I can analyze the relationship between model confidence and factual accuracy using coherence measures.

Building on validated baseline results, the scientist configures temperature ranges (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.2 increments) and executes the harness. The system automatically manages API calls, handles rate limiting, collects responses at each temperature, and outputs structured results ready for coherence analysis. The researcher can then apply Shogenji, Fitelson, and Olsson coherence measures to understand when and why models hallucinate, with confidence that deviations from baseline are due to temperature effects, not implementation errors.

### Developer Integrating New Benchmarks

As a developer, I want to easily add new hallucination benchmarks to the framework, so that I can extend the research capabilities without modifying core execution logic.

The developer creates a new benchmark class inheriting from BaseBenchmark, implements the required methods for dataset loading and evaluation, and registers it with the harness. The framework automatically handles execution, temperature variations, result collection, and integration with existing coherence analysis pipelines.

### ML Engineer Optimizing Performance

As an ML engineer, I want to efficiently run large-scale benchmark experiments, so that I can complete research iterations quickly while managing API costs.

The engineer configures batch sizes, uses the OpenAI Batch API for 50% cost savings on large runs, sets up parallel execution for independent samples, and monitors progress through detailed logging. The system provides token usage tracking, cost estimation, and automatic retries for failed requests.

## Spec Scope

1. **Benchmark Reproducibility System** - Exact replication of published benchmark methodologies with validation against known results and tolerance checking
2. **Benchmark Orchestration Engine** - Core execution framework that manages benchmark lifecycle, coordinates temperature variations, and handles result aggregation
3. **Baseline Validation Framework** - Comparison tools to verify our results match published benchmarks within acceptable tolerances before novel experiments
4. **Temperature Variant Analysis** - System for running the same prompt at multiple temperatures to collect coherence data (only after baseline validation)
5. **Async Execution Pipeline** - High-performance async architecture for parallel API calls with rate limiting and retry logic
6. **Result Collection Framework** - Structured data collection for benchmark results with support for both standard metrics and coherence measure analysis
7. **Progress Monitoring Interface** - Real-time tracking of benchmark execution with detailed logging and progress bars

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of specific benchmarks (FaithBench, SimpleQA, etc.) - these will be separate modules
- Coherence measure calculations - handled by dedicated analysis modules
- Web UI or interactive dashboards - CLI-based execution only
- Model fine-tuning or training - evaluation only
- Custom LLM implementations - uses existing API providers

## Expected Deliverable

1. Reproducible benchmark execution that matches published results for FaithBench, SimpleQA, and TruthfulQA within ±1% accuracy
2. Validation reports comparing our results against published baselines with detailed metric breakdowns
3. Executable benchmark harness that can run any registered benchmark with configurable temperature settings (after baseline validation)
4. Structured JSON/JSONL output files containing all responses and metadata for both standard evaluation and coherence analysis
5. Comprehensive test suite demonstrating harness functionality with mock benchmarks and API responses
6. Documentation proving reproducibility with example outputs matching published benchmark results
