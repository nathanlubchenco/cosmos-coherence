> Created: 2025-09-07

## Technical Requirements

### Reproducibility Foundation

- **Benchmark Reproducibility Validator**: Ensures exact reproduction of published results
  - Implements original evaluation logic for each benchmark (exact match, F1 score, etc.)
  - Supports deterministic execution with temperature=0 and fixed random seeds
  - Provides detailed comparison reports against published baselines
  - Validates results within acceptable tolerance (Â±1% of published scores)
  - Must pass reproducibility validation before enabling temperature variations

- **Reference Implementation Tracking**: Maintain fidelity to original benchmarks
  - Store original paper evaluation code or pseudo-code as reference
  - Document any necessary adaptations with justification
  - Track version compatibility (e.g., which GPT model version was used in original)
  - Provide side-by-side comparison of our implementation vs. reference

### Core Architecture

- **BenchmarkRunner Class**: Main orchestration class that manages benchmark execution lifecycle
  - Accepts BenchmarkRunConfig for runtime parameters (temperature ranges, batch sizes, retry settings)
  - Leverages existing BenchmarkConfig for defining which benchmarks to run
  - Coordinates with OpenAIClient for LLM interactions using existing batch API implementation
  - Implements async execution pipeline with configurable concurrency limits

- **BaseBenchmark Abstract Class**: Interface that all benchmarks must implement
  - `load_dataset()`: Returns list of BaseDatasetItem instances
  - `evaluate_response()`: Compares model response to ground truth using original benchmark metrics
  - `get_prompt()`: Formats dataset item into prompt exactly as specified in original benchmark
  - `validate_config()`: Ensures benchmark-specific settings are valid
  - `get_baseline_results()`: Returns published baseline scores for validation
  - `get_evaluation_method()`: Returns the original paper's evaluation methodology

- **Temperature Variation Engine**: Systematic temperature analysis
  - Configurable temperature ranges (e.g., [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0])
  - Parallel execution of same prompt at different temperatures
  - Result aggregation maintaining temperature-response mappings
  - Support for temperature-specific token tracking and cost estimation

- **Result Collector**: Structured data management
  - Implements BaseResult pattern for consistency
  - Stores raw responses, processed results, and metadata
  - Outputs JSONL format for streaming large result sets
  - Includes experiment tracking with unique run IDs and timestamps

### Integration Points

- **OpenAI Client Integration**: Leverage existing implementation
  - Use `batch_generate` for large-scale runs (50% cost savings)
  - Use `generate` for small-scale or interactive runs
  - Inherit retry logic, rate limiting, and error handling
  - Track tokens using existing TokenCounter class

- **Configuration System**: Build on existing Pydantic models
  - Extend BenchmarkRunConfig with harness-specific settings
  - Add HarnessConfig for orchestration parameters
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing configs

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability
  - Use structlog for structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Integrate tqdm for progress bars during long runs
  - Emit metrics for benchmarking performance analysis
  - Log all API errors and retries for debugging

### Performance Optimizations

- **Async Execution**: Maximum throughput
  - Use asyncio.gather for parallel temperature variations
  - Implement semaphore-based concurrency control
  - Queue-based task distribution for large datasets
  - Automatic batch formation for API efficiency

- **Memory Management**: Handle large datasets
  - Stream processing for datasets larger than memory
  - Lazy loading of benchmark data
  - Incremental result writing to prevent memory accumulation
  - Garbage collection hints after batch completions

- **Error Recovery**: Robust execution
  - Checkpoint system for resuming interrupted runs
  - Partial failure handling with detailed error reporting
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Dead letter queue for consistently failing items

### Data Flow

1. Load benchmark configuration and dataset
2. Initialize OpenAI client with appropriate settings
3. **Reproducibility Phase** (temperature=0, deterministic):
   - Run benchmark with original evaluation settings
   - Compare results against published baselines
   - Generate validation report
   - Abort if reproducibility check fails (>1% deviation)
4. **Extension Phase** (only after validation):
   - For each dataset item:
     - Generate prompts for all temperature settings
     - Execute API calls (batch or individual based on volume)
     - Collect and validate responses
     - Calculate both original and extended evaluation metrics
     - Store results with full metadata
5. Aggregate results and generate summary statistics
6. Output structured data files for analysis with clear separation of baseline and extended results

### Testing Strategy

- **Reproducibility Tests**: Baseline validation
  - Test exact reproduction of published FaithBench results
  - Test exact reproduction of SimpleQA evaluation logic
  - Test exact reproduction of TruthfulQA scoring
  - Validate tolerance checking (should fail if >1% deviation)
  - Test deterministic execution with fixed seeds

- **Unit Tests**: Component isolation
  - Mock benchmark implementations for harness testing
  - Async execution path validation
  - Configuration validation and merging
  - Result serialization and deserialization
  - Original evaluation metric implementations

- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows
  - Small benchmark runs with mock API responses
  - Temperature variation verification (after baseline validation)
  - Error recovery scenarios
  - Progress tracking and logging validation
  - Comparison report generation

- **Performance Tests**: Scalability validation
  - Large dataset handling (>10,000 items)
  - Memory usage profiling
  - Throughput measurements
  - API rate limit compliance
