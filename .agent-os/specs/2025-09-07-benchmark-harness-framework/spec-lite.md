# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a benchmark execution framework that prioritizes exact reproduction of published benchmark results (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA) to establish validated baselines before extending to temperature-variant analysis. The harness must first prove reproducibility within Â±1% tolerance, then enable novel coherence-based evaluation through systematic temperature variations, ensuring research builds on solid foundations of reproducible science.
