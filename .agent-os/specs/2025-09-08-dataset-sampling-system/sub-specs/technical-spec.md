# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-08-dataset-sampling-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **BenchmarkRunConfig Enhancement**: Add optional `sample_size: Optional[int] = None` field to the existing BenchmarkRunConfig model in `src/cosmos_coherence/benchmarks/models/base.py`
- **Dataset Slicing Logic**: Implement dataset limiting in the HuggingFaceDatasetLoader.load_dataset() method to return only first N items when sample_size is specified
- **CLI Parameter Addition**: Add `--sample-size` argument to the benchmark CLI commands in `src/cosmos_coherence/harness/cli.py` with type int and default None
- **Logging Enhancement**: Add clear log messages at INFO level when sampling is active, showing exact number of items being processed
- **Validation**: Ensure sample_size if provided is positive integer greater than 0
- **Backwards Compatibility**: When sample_size is None, system behaves exactly as before with full dataset processing

## Implementation Details

- The slicing should happen at the dataset loading stage, not during iteration, to avoid loading unnecessary data
- Use Python's standard slicing notation: `dataset[:sample_size]` for simplicity
- The sample_size parameter should propagate from CLI through to the dataset loader via BenchmarkRunConfig
- Results output should include a clear indicator that sampling was used (e.g., prefix results with "SAMPLE RUN")

Note: No external dependencies are needed since this uses Python's built-in slicing capabilities and existing Pydantic field definitions.
