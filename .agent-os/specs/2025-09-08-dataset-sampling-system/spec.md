> Spec: Dataset Sampling System
> Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Implement a simple dataset sampling mechanism that allows developers to quickly verify code execution with small dataset subsets. This feature prioritizes fast execution validation over statistical sampling robustness.

## User Stories

### Quick Execution Verification

As a developer, I want to run benchmarks with small dataset samples, so that I can quickly verify my code changes work without waiting for full dataset processing.

The developer makes code changes to the benchmark pipeline and wants to verify execution. They specify a sample size (e.g., 10 items) and run the benchmark. The system quickly processes only those items, allowing rapid iteration and debugging without the overhead of processing thousands of examples.

## Spec Scope

1. **Simple Sample Size Parameter** - Add a sample_size parameter to BenchmarkRunConfig that limits dataset items processed
2. **Head-based Sampling** - Take the first N items from each dataset for consistent, reproducible execution verification
3. **CLI Integration** - Support --sample-size flag in command-line interface for easy access
4. **Clear Output Indication** - Log messages and results clearly indicate when sampling mode is active

## Out of Scope

- Statistical sampling methods (stratified, random with seed, etc.)
- Sample representativeness validation
- Proportional sampling across multiple datasets
- Saving/loading specific sample sets
- Sample-based performance metrics or accuracy estimates

## Expected Deliverable

1. Ability to run any benchmark with a --sample-size parameter that processes only the first N items
2. Clear console output showing "Running in sample mode with N items" when sampling is active
3. All existing benchmarks work seamlessly with the sampling parameter without code changes
