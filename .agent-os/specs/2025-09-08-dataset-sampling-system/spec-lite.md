# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a simple dataset sampling mechanism that allows developers to quickly verify code execution with small dataset subsets (e.g., first 10 items) through a --sample-size CLI parameter. This feature prioritizes fast execution validation over statistical robustness, enabling rapid iteration during development without processing full datasets.
