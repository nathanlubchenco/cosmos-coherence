## Overview

HaluEval is a large-scale hallucination evaluation benchmark for LLMs, covering 35,000 samples across QA, dialogue, summarization, and general queries to systematically evaluate models' ability to detect hallucinated content. This implementation will integrate HaluEval into the Cosmos Coherence framework, providing researchers and developers with a comprehensive tool for evaluating hallucination detection capabilities across multiple task types.

## User Stories

**As a researcher evaluating hallucination detection:**
- I want to run HaluEval benchmarks on different LLMs to compare their hallucination detection performance
- I want to analyze results across different task types (QA, dialogue, summarization, general) to understand model strengths and weaknesses
- I want reproducible results that match the original HaluEval paper findings

**As a developer testing model robustness:**
- I want to integrate HaluEval testing into my model evaluation pipeline
- I want cached results to avoid repeated API calls during development
- I want clear metrics and reporting for hallucination detection accuracy

## Spec Scope

- **Dataset Integration**: Load and process HaluEval dataset with proper formatting for all task types
- **Hallucination Detection Evaluation**: Implement evaluation logic for detecting hallucinated content across different scenarios
- **Multi-Task Support**: Support all HaluEval task types including QA, dialogue, summarization, and general queries
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Calculate and report standard hallucination detection metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- **Framework Integration**: Integrate with existing Cosmos Coherence architecture, including caching system and CLI interface
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure results match original paper benchmarks for validation

## Out of Scope

- **Sample Generation**: Generating new hallucinated samples or extending the dataset
- **Prompt Modification**: Modifying or customizing the evaluation prompts from the original HaluEval methodology
- **HaluEval 2.0 Features**: Implementing features from potential future versions of HaluEval
- **Custom Task Types**: Adding task types beyond the four core HaluEval categories
- **Model Training**: Training or fine-tuning models for hallucination detection

## Expected Deliverable

- **Working HaluEval Benchmark**: Complete implementation that reproduces paper results with high fidelity
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for running HaluEval evaluations with configurable parameters
- **Caching Integration**: Full support for response caching to reduce API costs and enable rapid re-evaluation
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed reporting of hallucination detection performance across all task types
- **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions and integration examples
- **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests ensuring reliability and correctness
