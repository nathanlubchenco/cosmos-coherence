# HaluEval Benchmark Implementation - Lite Summary

Implement HaluEval benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect hallucinations across 35,000 samples in QA, dialogue, summarization, and general query tasks. The implementation will reproduce the paper's exact evaluation methodology with original prompts and metrics while integrating with our existing caching system for efficient API usage and cost management.

## Key Points
- Evaluate hallucination detection across 4 task types with 35K total samples
- Reproduce original paper methodology with exact prompts and scoring
- Integrate with existing caching infrastructure for cost-effective evaluation
