# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an in-memory LLM response cache with optional disk persistence to reduce API costs and speed up development iterations. The cache uses deterministic hashing of all request parameters (model, prompt, temperature, etc.) for exact-match lookups, transparently integrates with the OpenAI client, and provides simple hit/miss statistics to monitor effectiveness.
