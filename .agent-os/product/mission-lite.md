# Product Mission (Lite)

Cosmos Coherence is a research framework that advances LLM hallucination detection by applying formal philosophical coherence measures to benchmark evaluations, providing researchers with novel insights into model reliability through systematic temperature-variant response analysis.

This framework serves AI researchers studying hallucination patterns by unifying benchmark reproduction with novel coherence-based evaluation methods. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on simple accuracy metrics, Cosmos Coherence incorporates formal epistemological measures (Shogenji, Fitelson, Olsson) to analyze response consistency across temperature variations, revealing deeper insights into when and why models hallucinate.
