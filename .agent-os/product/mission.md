# Product Mission

## Pitch

Cosmos Coherence is a research framework that advances LLM hallucination detection by applying formal philosophical coherence measures to benchmark evaluations, providing researchers with novel insights into model reliability through systematic temperature-variant response analysis.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Academic Researchers**: AI/ML researchers studying hallucination detection and model reliability
- **Industry Research Teams**: Organizations developing or evaluating LLM systems for production use

### User Personas

**LLM Research Scientist** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Research Scientist / PhD Student
- **Context:** Academic or corporate research lab focused on LLM reliability
- **Pain Points:** Reproducing benchmark results is time-consuming, comparing different hallucination detection methods lacks standardization
- **Goals:** Publish novel research findings, improve LLM reliability metrics

**AI Safety Engineer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** ML Engineer / AI Safety Researcher
- **Context:** Tech company deploying LLMs in production
- **Pain Points:** Existing benchmarks don't capture nuanced hallucination patterns, difficulty in systematic evaluation across multiple dimensions
- **Goals:** Implement robust hallucination detection, ensure model outputs are trustworthy

## The Problem

### Inconsistent Hallucination Detection

Current LLM hallucination benchmarks lack systematic approaches to measuring response coherence and consistency. Research teams spend excessive time reproducing results and cannot easily compare across different philosophical frameworks of truth and coherence.

**Our Solution:** Provide a unified framework that reproduces existing benchmarks while introducing formal coherence measures from philosophy.

### Limited Insight into Response Variability

Researchers struggle to understand how temperature and sampling affect hallucination patterns. The relationship between response randomness and underlying model confidence remains opaque, limiting our understanding of when and why models hallucinate.

**Our Solution:** Systematic temperature-variant analysis with coherence scoring across multiple response samples.

### Fragmented Research Tooling

Implementing and comparing multiple benchmarks requires juggling different codebases, data formats, and evaluation metrics. This fragmentation slows research progress and makes it difficult to build upon existing work.

**Our Solution:** Unified Pydantic-based abstractions enabling seamless benchmark execution and extension.

## Differentiators

### Philosophical Grounding

Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on simple accuracy metrics, we incorporate formal coherence measures (Shogenji, Fitelson, Olsson) from epistemology. This results in deeper insights into the logical consistency of model outputs beyond surface-level correctness.

### Temperature-Coherence Analysis

Unlike static evaluation approaches, we systematically vary temperature and analyze coherence patterns across response distributions. This results in novel insights about the relationship between model uncertainty and hallucination likelihood.
