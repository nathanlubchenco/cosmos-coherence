## Core Principles

### Validation is the most important thing
- It is essential that we validate each step of the way and confirm that what we've done accomplishes the appropriate goal
- You MUST not mock data except in tests
- Pay attention to logging and error messages to understand failures
- Fail LOUDLY not quietly -- Don't have gracefull fallbacks

### Keep It Simple
- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones

### Optimize for Readability
- Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Don't add unnecessary comments 

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated business logic to private methods
- Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components
- Create utility functions for common operations

### File Structure
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Dependencies

### Choose Libraries Wisely
When adding third-party dependencies:
- Select the most popular and actively maintained option
- Check the library's GitHub repository for:
  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)
  - Active issue resolution
  - Number of stars/downloads
  - Clear documentation
