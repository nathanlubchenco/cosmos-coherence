# JavaScript Style Guide

## Note for Python/Dash Projects

This project primarily uses Python with Dash for frontend development. JavaScript is only used minimally for:
- Custom Dash clientside callbacks (if needed)
- External integrations requiring JS

For any necessary JavaScript, follow Python-like conventions:
- Use snake_case for variables (to match Python style)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document with clear comments
- Prefer Python callbacks over clientside callbacks when possible
