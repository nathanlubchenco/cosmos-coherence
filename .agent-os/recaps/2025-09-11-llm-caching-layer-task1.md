# [2025-09-11] Recap: LLM Caching Layer - Task 1

This recaps what was built for Task 1 of the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-llm-caching-layer/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the core caching mechanism for LLM responses with comprehensive testing and thread-safe operations. The implementation includes deterministic hash generation, in-memory cache storage, and performance statistics tracking.

Key accomplishments:
- Created LLMCache class with thread-safe operations using RLock
- Implemented SHA256-based cache key generation for request parameters
- Added lookup_or_compute pattern for efficient cache-miss handling
- Included CacheStatistics tracking for hit rates and cost savings estimation
- Comprehensive test suite with 19 test cases covering all functionality
- Thread safety validation with concurrent operation tests
- All tests passing with 100% coverage of cache module

## Context

Implement an in-memory LLM response cache with optional disk persistence to reduce API costs and speed up development iterations. The cache uses deterministic hashing of all request parameters (model, prompt, temperature, etc.) for exact-match lookups, transparently integrates with the OpenAI client, and provides simple hit/miss statistics to monitor effectiveness.
