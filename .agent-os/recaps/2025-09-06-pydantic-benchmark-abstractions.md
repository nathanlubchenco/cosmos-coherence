# Pydantic Benchmark Abstractions - Project Recap

> **Spec:** Pydantic Benchmark Abstractions
> **Date:** 2025-09-06
> **Status:** In Progress (Task 1 of 5 Complete)

## Overview

This recap documents the progress made on implementing type-safe Pydantic data models for managing the complete benchmark workflow from dataset handling through result consumption. The goal is to provide comprehensive support for multiple hallucination detection benchmarks with validation and serialization capabilities.

## Completed Features Summary

### âœ… Task 1: Base Models and Core Abstractions

**Objective:** Create the foundational Pydantic models that serve as the backbone for all benchmark data structures.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Comprehensive Base Model Structure:** Implemented `BaseDatasetItem`, `BaseExperiment`, and `BaseResult` abstract base classes with proper inheritance hierarchy
- **BenchmarkConfig Model:** Created configuration model for benchmark parameters including temperature settings, coherence measures, and evaluation strategies
- **Generic DataPoint Class:** Implemented type-safe generic `DataPoint[T_Input, T_Output]` for flexible benchmark processing
- **ValidationMixin Implementation:** Built comprehensive validation patterns for common use cases including UUID format, score ranges (0.0-1.0), temperature validation (0.3-1.0), and string validation
- **Custom Field Types and Serialization:** Added JSON/JSONL serialization helpers with custom encoders for UUID and datetime objects
- **Enum Support:** Implemented `BenchmarkType`, `CoherenceMeasure`, and `EvaluationStrategy` enums for type safety
- **Model Inheritance Structure:** Designed extensible architecture with proper abstract method definitions
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Implemented extensive test suite covering all base model functionality, validation patterns, and serialization methods

**Technical Impact:**
- Established type-safe foundation for all benchmark data operations
- Enabled consistent validation patterns across the framework
- Provided robust serialization capabilities for data persistence
- Created extensible architecture for adding new benchmark types
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes

## Remaining Work

### ðŸ”„ Task 2: Dataset-Specific Models
- FaithBench dataset model with factual consistency checking and evidence tracking
- SimpleQA model with straightforward Q&A structure and grounding validation
- TruthfulQA model with truthfulness scoring and informativeness metrics
- FEVER model with claim verification, evidence retrieval, and verdict classification
- HaluEval model with hallucination detection across different generation tasks

### ðŸ”„ Task 3: Experiment and Result Models
- Experiment model with configuration, metadata, and execution tracking
- Result model with score tracking, timing, and error handling
- Metrics model with statistical calculations and benchmarking standards
- ExperimentRun model for individual test executions and their outcomes
- Aggregation models for batch processing and summary statistics

### ðŸ”„ Task 4: Serialization and Validation
- Custom JSON encoders/decoders for complex data types
- JSONL streaming support for large dataset processing
- Comprehensive field validators with meaningful error messages
- Schema versioning and migration support
- Performance optimizations for large dataset serialization

### ~~Task 5: API Integration Models~~ (Deferred to Phase 3)
*Note: API integration has been moved to Phase 3 of the roadmap, when we build the dashboard and API layer. This allows us to focus on core benchmark functionality first.*

## Key Outcomes

1. **Foundation Established:** Core Pydantic abstractions are now in place with comprehensive validation and serialization capabilities
2. **Type Safety Implemented:** All base models provide type-safe operations with proper generic typing support
3. **Validation Framework Ready:** ValidationMixin provides consistent validation patterns for all benchmark types
4. **Serialization Support:** JSON/JSONL serialization helpers enable data persistence and API integration
5. **Test Coverage Complete:** Comprehensive test suite validates all base model functionality

## Next Steps

The immediate priorities are:

1. **Task 2: Dataset-Specific Models** - Implement concrete models for each of the 5 hallucination detection benchmarks (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA, FEVER, HaluEval)
2. **Task 3: Experiment and Result Models** - Build tracking and evaluation structures
3. **Task 4: Serialization and Validation** - Complete the data persistence layer

API integration (previously Task 5) has been deferred to Phase 3 of the roadmap to maintain focus on core benchmark functionality.

## Technical Notes

- Base models use proper abstract base class patterns with required method implementations
- Generic typing with `TypeVar` provides flexibility for different input/output types
- Custom exception hierarchy enables detailed error reporting and debugging
- Serialization helpers support both single-item and batch processing workflows
- ValidationMixin pattern allows for composable validation across all model types
- Enum-based type constraints ensure data integrity and prevent invalid values
