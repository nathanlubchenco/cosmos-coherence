# Dataset Sampling System - Project Recap

> **Spec:** Dataset Sampling System
> **Date:** 2025-09-08
> **Status:** COMPLETE (All 5 tasks fully implemented)

## Overview

This recap documents the implementation of a simple dataset sampling mechanism that allows developers to quickly verify code execution with small dataset subsets. The feature prioritizes fast execution validation over statistical robustness, enabling rapid iteration during development without processing full datasets through a `--sample-size` CLI parameter.

## Completed Features Summary

### ✅ Task 1: BenchmarkRunConfig Sample Size Parameter

**Objective:** Add sample_size parameter to BenchmarkRunConfig that limits dataset items processed.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Pydantic Model Enhancement:** Added optional `sample_size` field to `BenchmarkRunConfig` in `/Users/nathanlubchenco/workspace/cosmos-coherence/src/cosmos_coherence/benchmarks/models/base.py`
- **Field Validation:** Implemented positive integer validation using `Field(None, ge=1)` to ensure valid sample sizes
- **Type Safety:** Used `Optional[int]` typing for optional parameter with proper None handling
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Created test suite covering configuration validation, field constraints, and edge cases
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensured existing configurations continue to work without sample_size specified

**Technical Impact:**
- Established type-safe foundation for sampling across all benchmark configurations
- Enabled flexible sample size specification with proper validation
- Maintained full backwards compatibility with existing benchmark runs

### ✅ Task 2: Dataset Slicing in HuggingFaceDatasetLoader

**Objective:** Implement head-based sampling that takes the first N items from each dataset for consistent, reproducible execution verification.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Core Sampling Logic:** Modified `load_dataset` method in `HuggingFaceDatasetLoader` to handle sample_size parameter
- **Head-based Slicing:** Implemented simple `.select(range(sample_size))` for consistent, reproducible sampling
- **Sample Mode Logging:** Added clear logging with "SAMPLE MODE" prefix indicating when sampling is active
- **Multi-dataset Support:** Ensured slicing works with all existing dataset types (FaithBench, SimpleQA, TruthfulQA, FEVER, HaluEval)
- **Performance Optimization:** Early dataset termination reduces memory usage and processing time
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Validated slicing functionality across different dataset sizes and edge cases

**Technical Impact:**
- Enabled fast dataset loading for development and testing scenarios
- Provided consistent sampling behavior across all benchmark types
- Maintained dataset integrity while reducing processing overhead
- Clear logging helps developers understand when sampling mode is active

### ✅ Task 3: CLI Integration for --sample-size Parameter

**Objective:** Support --sample-size flag in command-line interface for easy access.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Typer CLI Integration:** Added `--sample-size` parameter to both `run-baseline` and `run-benchmark` commands
- **Parameter Propagation:** Ensured sample_size flows from CLI arguments through to BenchmarkRunConfig
- **Help Documentation:** Added clear help text: "Number of dataset items to process (for quick testing)"
- **Type Safety:** Proper `Optional[int]` typing with None default for optional usage
- **Command Consistency:** Both benchmark execution modes support the same sampling interface
- **Validation Integration:** CLI parameter validation leverages Pydantic model constraints

**Technical Impact:**
- Provided developer-friendly interface for quick testing and validation
- Maintained consistent CLI patterns across benchmark commands
- Enabled rapid iteration workflows without configuration file changes
- Clear parameter documentation for ease of use

### ✅ Task 4: Sample Mode Output Indicators

**Objective:** Log messages and results clearly indicate when sampling mode is active.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Result Model Enhancement:** Added `sample_mode` and `sample_size` fields to `BenchmarkRunResult`
- **Console Output Indicators:** Implemented yellow-highlighted "SAMPLE RUN" prefix in CLI output
- **Run Summary Integration:** Sample size included in benchmark result summaries
- **Logging Integration:** Clear "SAMPLE MODE" logging in HuggingFace dataset loader
- **Visual Distinction:** Color-coded output helps distinguish sample runs from full runs
- **Progress Tracking:** Sample mode indicators work with existing progress bar systems

**Technical Impact:**
- Clear visual feedback prevents confusion between sample and full runs
- Helps developers understand the scope of their test runs
- Provides audit trail for sample-based development work
- Integrates seamlessly with existing output and logging systems

### ✅ Task 5: End-to-End Integration Testing

**Objective:** Comprehensive testing to ensure the sampling system works across all benchmark types and scenarios.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Multi-size Testing:** Validated functionality with various sample sizes (1, 10, 100)
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Verified no regressions when sample_size is not specified
- **Cross-benchmark Validation:** Tested sampling with all supported benchmark types
- **Performance Verification:** Confirmed significant performance improvements with sampling
- **Integration Test Suite:** Comprehensive test coverage for CLI, configuration, and execution paths
- **Edge Case Handling:** Tested boundary conditions and error scenarios

**Technical Impact:**
- Validated end-to-end functionality across the entire system
- Ensured no regressions in existing benchmark functionality
- Confirmed performance benefits for development workflows
- Established confidence in sampling system reliability

## Key Outcomes

1. **Developer Productivity:** Simple `--sample-size` parameter enables rapid code verification
2. **Consistent Behavior:** Head-based sampling provides reproducible results across runs
3. **Clear Feedback:** Visual indicators prevent confusion between sample and full benchmark runs
4. **Universal Support:** All existing benchmark types work seamlessly with sampling
5. **Performance Improvement:** Significant speedup for development and testing workflows
6. **Zero Breaking Changes:** Full backwards compatibility maintained

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Modified:
- **BenchmarkRunConfig** (`/Users/nathanlubchenco/workspace/cosmos-coherence/src/cosmos_coherence/benchmarks/models/base.py`): Added optional sample_size field
- **HuggingFaceDatasetLoader** (`/Users/nathanlubchenco/workspace/cosmos-coherence/src/cosmos_coherence/harness/huggingface_loader.py`): Implemented dataset slicing logic
- **CLI Interface** (`/Users/nathanlubchenco/workspace/cosmos-coherence/src/cosmos_coherence/harness/cli.py`): Added --sample-size parameter support
- **BenchmarkRunner** (`/Users/nathanlubchenco/workspace/cosmos-coherence/src/cosmos_coherence/harness/benchmark_runner.py`): Added sample mode tracking and output

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Head-based Sampling:** Chose first N items for consistency over random sampling
- **Optional Parameter:** Made sample_size optional to maintain backwards compatibility
- **Clear Indicators:** Added visual cues to distinguish sample runs from full runs
- **Universal Integration:** Ensured sampling works with all benchmark types without modification

## Next Steps

With the dataset sampling system complete, developers can now:

1. **Rapid Testing:** Use `--sample-size 10` for quick code verification
2. **Development Iteration:** Test changes without waiting for full dataset processing
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Use sampling for fast validation in development pipelines
4. **Debugging Workflows:** Process small datasets for easier debugging and analysis

The sampling system provides the foundation for efficient development workflows while maintaining the ability to run full-scale benchmarks when needed.

## Technical Notes

- Sample size validation ensures positive integers only (ge=1 constraint)
- Head-based sampling provides deterministic, reproducible results
- Sample mode logging uses clear "SAMPLE MODE" prefix for visibility
- CLI output includes yellow-highlighted "SAMPLE RUN" indicators
- All existing tests pass, ensuring no regressions introduced
- Performance improvement scales with sample size reduction
- Memory usage reduced proportionally with smaller sample sizes
